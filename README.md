# Project-2-CRUD Grand Garage 
This is my second project for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp.

## Description 
It is a website where you can buy and sell items, the items are posted by other users. 
This project has 5 main pages, the home page, the page that lists all the items, a page to add items, a page with the description of an item, a cart page

## Wins 
One major win from this project was being able to implement full CRUD (Create Read Update Delete), I was able to accomplish at least one of each CRUD function.

Another win from this project was being able to implement googles OAuth, this was something I thought was going to be very difficult however it was not as big a problem as I had anticipated, albeit it was still difficult.

## Hurdles 
The single largest hurdle that I faced in this project was being able to take items from one page and move them to another page while simultaneously moving them from one object to another. 

Some other smaller hurdles were the sheer amount of bugs that I had, for every function I implemented there were countless bugs. Each function required extremely thorough testing to make sure It worked properly

## Next Steps 
There are multiple things that I plan on implementing and these include 
* A range finder so you can see items in your area
* Adding the ability to upload an image of your item listed 
* The ability to purchase items with real currency
